Key public services with trans-European relevance are intended to give rise to major benefits for citizens where they become interoperable across borders. Examples of trans-European digital public services are services that, by means of cross-border exchanges of data, allow for the mutual recognition of academic diplomas or professional qualifications, exchanges of vehicle data for road safety, access to social security and health data, including pandemic and vaccination certificates, access to single window systems, the exchange of information related to taxation, customs, public tender accreditation, digital driving licenses or commercial registers, and in general all those services that implement the

                    <TXT>Cross-border interoperability is not solely enabled by means of centralised digital infrastructures in the Member States, but also by means of a decentralised approach. This entails the need for trust between public administrations, allowing for data exchange between local administrations in different Member States without necessarily going through national nodes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop common interoperability solutions that are reusable across all administrative levels. Interoperability solutions encompass different forms ranging from higher-level tools like conceptual frameworks and guidelines to more technical solutions such as reference architectures, technical specifications or standards. Moreover, concrete services and applications, as well as documented technical components such as source code, including artefacts and artificial intelligence models can be interoperability solutions, if they address legal, organisational, semantic, or technical aspects of cross-border interoperability. Needs for cross-border digital interactions are increasing, which requires solutions that can fulfil those needs. This Regulation intends to facilitate and encourage exchanges at all levels of administration, overcoming cross-border barriers and administrative burdens, thereby increasing the efficiency of public services across the Union.</TXT>

                    <TXT>Interoperability facilitates the successful implementation of policies, in particular those with a strong public sector connection, such as justice and home affairs, taxation and customs, transport, energy, health, agriculture, and employment, as well as in business and industry regulation. However, a single sector interoperability perspective is associated with the risk that the adoption of different or incompatible solutions at national or sectoral levels will give rise to new electronic barriers that impede the proper functioning of the internal market and the associated freedoms of movement. Furthermore, it risks undermining the openness and competitiveness of markets and the delivery of services of general interest to citizens and business. Therefore, this Regulation should also facilitate, encourage and apply to cross-sector interoperability, thereby supporting the removal of barriers, incompatibilities and the fragmentation of digital public services.</TXT>

In such cases, the interoperability assessment should be strongly encouraged to go beyond the achievement of the Interoperable Europe objectives towards the full implementation of interoperability. Similarly, the requirements for interoperability assessments conducted at the level of single project implementation, such as in a local authority, should be pragmatic and allow for a narrow focus, taking into account the fact that the wider benefits of interoperability assessments are generally harvested at the early stages of policy design and the development of reference architecture, specifications and standards.

Beyond training on Interoperable Europe solutions, all initiatives should, where appropriate, build on, or be accompanied by, the sharing of experience and solutions and the exchange and promotion of best practices. To that end, the Commission should develop training courses and training materials, and should promote the development of a certification programme on interoperability matters in order to promote best practices, qualifications for human resources and a culture of excellence. The Commission should contribute to the increase of the general availability and uptake of training on public sector interoperability at national, regional and local level, in line with the Union strategies for digital skills.

In particular, it could contribute to facilitating the transfer of technologies, tools, measures and processes among the participants of peer review. Peer review should create a functional path for the sharing of best practices across Member States and Union entities with different levels of maturity in interoperability. It should be possible to carry out peer review on a voluntary basis upon the request of a Union entity or a public sector body where necessary.

Where appropriate the request shall specify information such as the purpose of the processing of personal data, the actors involved and their roles, the categories of personal data concerned and their sources, and the envisaged retention period. The consultation shall not replace the prior consultation referred to in Article 36 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 40 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Where the interoperability regulatory sandbox is established for interoperability solutions supporting the cross-border interoperability of trans-European digital public services by one or more Union entities, including with the participation of public sector bodies, no authorisation shall be required.</ALINEA>
